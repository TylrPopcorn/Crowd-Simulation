# Crowd-Simulation
A simple ROBLOX Game Development collaboration made with a friend.

------
**Getting Started**


This model provides your game with a simulated crowd effect. The more 'people' (blocks) you have, the more active and attractive your environment may feel.

Download the model and open up a new empty ROBLOX studio experience. Insert the crowd model into the experience and follow the instructions in the main code.
